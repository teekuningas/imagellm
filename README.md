# imagellm

Implements a simple Chat UI, that extends OpenAI's LLM models so that the bot is able to embed images to the chat. The bot is instructed to add a placeholder when appropriate and the images are post-hoc queried from the Google Image Search API. Also see, https://github.com/teekuningas/imagellm-api
